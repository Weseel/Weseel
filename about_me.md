# My First GitHub Project ðŸš€

## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Bruno, currently studying Managment of Information Systems at FCE-UBA (Argentina). Iâ€™m just starting out with coding and GitHub, so this repo is where Iâ€™m testing things out as I learn.

## Project Info
This repo is like my personal sandbox where I:
- Practice coding.
- Share notes on things Iâ€™m learning, especially in Python.
- Experimenting with small projects while learning new things.

Nothing too fancy yet, but we all start somewhere, right?

## Contributing
